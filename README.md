# Selenium (POM - Page Object Model) and Cucumber BDD

## What's in this repository?
This project is implements a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach using Selenium (POM), Cucumber, testNg and JUnit. It is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable for testing web applications.

## What's the purpose of this project?
The purpose of this project is to implement what I have learned in web automation testing using Cucumber Selenium with Java programming language.

## Key Features
- TestNG for test execution and reporting
- Maven for dependency management
- Console logging
- Parallel testing
- Extent Reports for test reporting
- Read config from properties file
- Screenshot test case (Fail scenario)
- PDF Reporting

## Technologies
- Java 21
- Apache Maven
- Selenium
- Cucumber BDD
- TestNG Framework
- Log4j2
- ExtentReport

```https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/index.html```

### 2. Viewing the reports
The test reports can be found in:<br />
```./target```<br />
```./test-output```<br />
The report will be generated upon execution and will include screenshots if any failures occur during the testing process.
